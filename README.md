### Monotony
*Weighin yr pages*

Monotony is a simple Sinatra app that fetches the content size (in bytes) of a given web page (in this case, [Artsy](www.artsy.net)) from the HTTP response header, uploads it to a database, and displays values from the past week. Used as a rough gauge to figure out how the page weight of a given site is changing over time. The values are generated by a rake task run daily via Heroku Scheduler.

To run manually, create your database with `bundle exec rake create`, `bundle exec rake migrate`, then `bundle exec rake daily_measure` (generate measurement values) to your heart's content.
